ARM Architecture project    - Kavya Borra and Yashaswi Mannepalli

We tried extracting temperature and humidity data from DHT22 Temperature sensor and display it on the LCD display. 
We used STMCUBE MX to create a project for keil uVision with initialising the GPIO input and output pins. 
Data communication channel was created but we were not able to display the values on LCD display.
